<h1>Resistor Calculator</h1>
<p>
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code">electronic color code</a> is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, very commonly for resistors. There are <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band">lots</a><a href="http://www.1728.org/resisclr.htm"> of different </a><a href="http://www.bobborst.com/tools/resistor-color-codes/">implementations</a> online <a href="http://www.electronics2000.co.uk/calc/resistor-code-calculator.php">already</a>, but we believe <em>you</em> can do better. We've been hard at work on the back-end code and now your goal is to knock our socks off with a user interface that implements that!
</p>
<p>
    Provided are two implementations of the calculator: <a href="calculator-plain.js">a plain Javascript version</a> and a <a href="calculator.js">Node.js module</a>. They are essentially identical and you can use either one. Pick whichever one is more convenient for you.
</p>
<p>
    Use your imagination! Get creative! All we ask is that your submission be self-contained and easy to view and use without requiring us to install a lot of tools or frameworks. Place your submission in a public Github repository and send us the clone URL. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck!
